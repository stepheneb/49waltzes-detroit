1
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.130
PEOPLE ARE MARCHING TO TELL THE CITY MANAGER

2
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.120
THAT WE DON'T WANT HIM TOUCHING THE ART
TO BAIL THE CITY OUT.

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.180
I'M GOING TO GO OVER THIS CHANT SLOWLY

4
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.280
AND THEN WE ARE GOIN TO GET A LITTLE BIT

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.280
OF A RHYTHMIC THING GOING ON AS WE MARCH.

6
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.070
AS YOU KNOW

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.240
THE CITY IS BANKRUPT, OR SO THEY SAY.

8
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.080
18.5 MILLION DOLLARS.

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.270
PART OF THE PLAN IS TO SELL ART WORK

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.270
FROM THE DIA,
WHICH HAS BEEN PUBLICLY FUNDED

11
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.060
SO THEREFORE ITÃ•S APPARENTLY SUBJECT TO SALE
THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY LAW.

12
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.060
AND WE'RE HERE TO SAY

13
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.070
THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.

14
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.100
THIS IS OUR MUSEUM, OUR ART.

15
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.280
WE SAY THAT THE ART BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE.

16
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.160
INSIDE IS THE DIEGO RIVERA MURAL

17
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.270
WHICH WAS PAINTED IN THE 1030'S BY DIEGO RIVERA,

18
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.110
A SOCIALIST AND A PARTISAN OF THE WORKING CLASS.

19
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.120
IN THE 1930'S WORKERS DEFENDED|THAT MURAL

20
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.080
AGAINST THE FASCIST SYMPATHIZER, FATHER COUGHLIN

21
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.100
FROM HIS CHURCH IN ROYAL OAK

22
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.250
WHO WANTED THE MURAL DESTROYED.

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.200
WE FEEL NOW THAT WE HAVE TO MOBILIZE PEOPLE
IN DEFENSE OF THE RIGHT TO CULTURE.

24
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.200
<i>THE WORKING CLASS IS HERE TO FIGHT</i>
<i>CULTURE IS A SOCIAL RIGHT.</i>

25
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.170
THE DIA IS A STATEMENT
ABOUT THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN THIS COUNTRY.

26
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.120
EVERYBODY HERE IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER
ARE HURTING.

27
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.100
AND WE KNOW THAT TREASURES LIKE THE DIA

28
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.210
ONCE THEY ARE DESTROYED
THEY ARE GONE FOR EVER.

29
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.220
<i>HANDS OFF THE DIA</i>
<i>HANDS OFF THE DIA</i>

30
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.100
<i>HANDS OFF THE DIA</i>

31
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.090
<i>CULTURE IS A SOCIAL RIGHT</i>

32
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.250
<i>THE WORKING CLASS IS HERE TO FIGHT</i>

33
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.050
<i>HANDS OFF THE DIA</i>

34
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.020
THESE ARE TREASURES THAT BELONG TO EVERYBODY.

35
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.060
AND THEY ARE SUCH AN ESSENTIAL PART OF DETROIT

36
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.070
THAT I DON'T THINK ANYTHING SHOULD BE SOLD OFF.

37
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.240
I THINK THEY SHOULD FIGURE OUT
SOME OTHER WAY TO MAKE THE MONEY.
